Basic demo that uses the new ClickCall web service that is supported by Ericsson-LG iPECS UCP.

### UCP ClickCall Web Service

The ClickCall service is the first open web service Ericsson-LG adds to iPECS UCP. It is very basic and only supports one function; an external application can make a device that uses IPKTU protocol dial any number.

This may not sound like much, but actually means you can do a lot of things. You can call an internal or external number and use feature codes like dnd, forwarding and so on.

### More information

The try-it-out form on this page can be used to test the feature in your own UCP. I have also included a <a href="http://www.licab.se/clickcall/mini.php">minimalistic demo</a> that only includes the basic witch can be a good start if you like to try by yourself.

Basic documentation with an example of <a href="/clickcall/doc.php">how to configure ClickCall in iPECS UCP</a>.

The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/ropaolle/ucp-clickcall-demo">GitHub</a>. If you have any comments please feel free to add a new issue in the <a href="https://github.com/ropaolle/ucp-clickcall-demo/issues">issue queue</a>.

## TODO

- [ ] Use Apollo for local state. Store local table config with localeStorage.
- [ ] Use Apollo [Optimistic UI](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/performance/optimistic-ui/), [Utbildning](https://github.com/FrontendMasters/fullstack-graphql/blob/solution/client/src/pages/Pets.js)

## Nice to have

- [ ] Debug Chrome/Next and Keystone
- [ ] Schema directives, needs to be added to the type definition and is not supported by KeystoneJS, [Schema directives](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/schema-directives/).

## Info

```sh
# Kill all node processes
